# movie-booking-project

### Description

To build a MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack movie booking application and deploy it using Docker Compose for the backend and frontend, you can follow these general steps:

1. Set up the Backend:
   - Create a new Express.js server to handle the backend logic.
   - Define the required API routes for movie data, user authentication, bookings, etc.
   - Connect the server to a MongoDB database using a MongoDB driver like Mongoose.
   - Implement the necessary controllers and models to handle CRUD operations and database interactions.
   - Write unit tests to ensure the backend functions as expected.

2. Set up the Frontend:
   - Initialize a new React.js project using Create React App.
   - Design and develop the frontend components, including views for movie listings, booking forms, user authentication, etc.
   - Connect the frontend to the backend API endpoints using Axios or Fetch for making HTTP requests.
   - Implement form validation and handle user interactions.
   - Test the frontend components and functionality.

3. Dockerize the Backend:
   - Create a Dockerfile in the backend directory to define the backend image.
   - Specify the base image (e.g., Node.js) and copy the backend code into the image.
   - Install the dependencies using `npm install`.
   - Expose the necessary ports for the backend server to listen on.
   - Define the startup command to run the backend server.

4. Dockerize the Frontend:
   - Create a Dockerfile in the frontend directory to define the frontend image.
   - Specify the base image (e.g., Node.js) and copy the frontend code into the image.
   - Install the dependencies using `npm install`.
   - Build the frontend application using `npm run build`.
   - Expose the necessary ports for the frontend server to serve the static files.
   - Define the startup command to run the frontend server.

5. Create a Docker Compose File:
   - Create a `docker-compose.yml` file in the project's root directory.
   - Define two services: one for the backend and one for the frontend.
   - Configure the backend service with the appropriate image, port mappings, environment variables, and volumes.
   - Configure the frontend service with the appropriate image, port mappings, and volumes.
   - Specify any dependencies or links between the services.

6. Build and Deploy the Application:
   - Run `docker-compose build` to build the backend and frontend images.
   - Run `docker-compose up` to start the containers and deploy the application.
   - Access the movie booking application in a web browser using the specified ports.
   - Test the deployed application and ensure it functions correctly.

By following these steps, you can build a MERN stack movie booking application and deploy it using Docker Compose for both the backend and frontend components. This approach allows for easier deployment and scalability by packaging the application and its dependencies into containers.
